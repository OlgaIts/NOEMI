# NOEMI 
[Noemi](https://olgaits.github.io/NOEMI/) is a blog about creativity, sports and lifestyle.

Training work on the layout (see the layout [here](https://github.com/netology-code/html-2-diploma/blob/master/sources/NOEMI_Modern_ru.jpg)).


In the code, sometimes there are strange margins and paddings - this is all because it was necessary to make the Pixel Perfect, and with a Photoshop layout it is more difficult than with a Figma layout.


Probably in a few months / years, I will look at the code, and I will be ashamed ðŸ¤¦ ... But for 6 weeks of study, this is a good result.
